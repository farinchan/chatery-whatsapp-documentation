## What is a Community Node?

n8n community nodes are custom integrations created by the community rather than the n8n team. They extend n8n's capabilities by connecting to services that don't have official integrations.

**Key points about community nodes:**

- ✅ **Open Source** - Source code is publicly available on GitHub
- ✅ **Easy to Install** - Can be installed directly from the n8n interface
- ✅ **Full Functionality** - Same capabilities as official nodes
- ⚠️ **Community Support** - Maintained by community contributors
- ⚠️ **Use at Your Own Risk** - Not officially verified by n8n

## Tips & Best Practices

2. **Handle Errors**: Add error handling nodes to manage API failures
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add delay nodes when sending bulk messages

5. **Webhook Security**: Use n8n's built-in authentication for webhook endpoints
