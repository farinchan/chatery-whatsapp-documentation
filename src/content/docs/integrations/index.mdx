## Integration Methods

If you need to integrate with platforms that don't have a dedicated integration, you can use:

### 1. REST API

Chatery provides a full REST API that can be used with any HTTP client or platform that supports HTTP requests.

```http
POST /api/whatsapp/chats/send-text
Content-Type: application/json
X-Api-Key: your_api_key

{
  "sessionId": "mysession",
  "chatId": "628123456789",
  "message": "Hello from your app!"
}
```

### 2. Webhooks

Configure webhooks to receive real-time events and trigger actions in your application:

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
  "events": ["message", "connection.update"]
}
```

### 3. WebSocket

For real-time bidirectional communication:

```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

socket.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('New message:', data);
});
```
